**_TASK 1_**

**Opening hours API.**

_description:_
Api converts raw format of input data with unix time to readable format.
Rest API and basic objects are generated automatically using OpenAPI specification placed in /specs directory  

_input ex._
``` 
{
    "monday": [],
    "tuesday": [
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 36000
        },
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 64800
        }
    ],
    "wednesday": [],
    "thursday": [
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 37800
        },
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 64800
        }
    ],
    "friday": [
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 36000
        }
    ],
    "saturday": [
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 3600
        },
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 32400
        },
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 39600
        },
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 57600
        },
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 82800
        }
    ],
    "sunday": [
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 3600
        },
        {
            "type": "open",
            "value": 43200
        },
        {
            "type": "close",
            "value": 75600
        }
    ]
} 
```

_output ex._
``` 
{
    "Monday": "Closed",
    "Tuesday": "10:00 AM - 06:00 PM",
    "Wednesday": "Closed",
    "Thursday": "10:30 AM - 06:00 PM",
    "Friday": "10:00 AM - 01:00 AM",
    "Saturday": "09:00 AM - 11:00 AM, 04:00 PM - 11:00 PM",
    "Sunday": "12:00 PM - 09:00 PM"
}
```
_Technologies:_  
Project build with
* [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).  
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* [Swagger and OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/)  
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

_How to start_  
To start project on localhost we need to run Dockerfile placed in the root directory.  
Docker starts gradle build command and runs application within container.

_How to use_  
Applications starts on http://localhost:8080/  
and accepts POST requests with body on /opening-hours path. Body can be taken from the example above.  
Another approach is using of SwaggerUI on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

**_TASK 2_**

One of the best modern alternative of JSON is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). 
It has the same benefits as JSON, but it's more concise and flexible

``` 
type Sunday {
type: String
value: Int
}

type Saturday {
type: String
value: Int
}

type Friday {
type: String
value: Int
}

type Thursday {
type: String
value: Int
}

type Tuesday {
type: String
value: Int
}

type AutogeneratedMainType {
sunday: [Sunday]
saturday: [Saturday]
friday: [Friday]
thursday: [Thursday]
wednesday: [String]
tuesday: [Tuesday]
monday: [String]
} 
```


As we can see from this example  GraphQL has already prepared type structure that can be used without additional conversion
